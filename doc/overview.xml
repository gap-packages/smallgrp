The Small Groups library gives access to all groups of certain <Q>small</Q>
orders. The groups are sorted by their orders and they are listed up to
isomorphism; that is, for each of the available orders a complete and
irredundant list of isomorphism type representatives of groups is given.
Currently, the library contains the following groups:
<P/>
<List>
<Item>
 those of order at most 2000 except 1024 &nbsp; (<M>423\;164\;062</M> groups);
</Item>
<Item>
 those of cubefree order at most 50 000 &nbsp; (<M>395 \; 703</M> groups);
</Item>
<Item>
 those of order <M>p^7</M> for the primes <M>p = 3,5,7,11</M>
 &nbsp; (<M>907 \; 489</M> groups);
</Item>
<Item>
 those of order <M>p^n</M> for <M>n \leq 6</M> and all primes <M>p</M> 
</Item>
<Item>
 those of order <M>q^n \cdot p</M> for <M>q^n</M> dividing <M>2^8</M>, 
                   <M>3^6</M>, <M>5^5</M> or <M>7^4</M> and all primes <M>p</M> with <M>p \neq q</M>;
</Item>
<Item>
 those of squarefree order;
</Item>
<Item>
 those whose order factorises into at most 3 primes.
</Item>
</List>
<P/>
The first three items in this list cover an explicit range of orders; the 
last four provide access to infinite families of groups having orders of 
certain types.
<P/>
The library also has an identification function: it returns the library 
number of a given group. This function determines library numbers using
invariants of groups. The function is available for all orders in the 
library except for the orders 512 and 1536 and except for the orders
<M>p^5</M>, <M>p^6</M> and <M>p^7</M> above 2000.
<P/>
The library is organised in 11 layers. Each layer contains the groups of
certain orders and their corresponding group identification routines. It
is possible to install the first <M>n</M> layers of the group library and the
first <M>m</M> layers of the group identification for each <M>1 \leq m \leq n
\leq 11</M>. This might be useful to save disk space. There is an extensive
<F>README</F> file for the Small Groups library available in the <C>small</C> directory
of the &GAP; distribution containing detailed information on the layers.
A brief description of the layers is given here:
<List>
<Mark>(1)</Mark>
<Item>
 the groups whose order factorises into at most 3 primes.
</Item>
<Mark>(2)</Mark>
<Item>
 the remaining groups of order at most 1000 except 512 and 768.
</Item>
<Mark>(3)</Mark>
<Item>
 the remaining groups of order <M>2^n \cdot p</M> with <M>n \leq 8</M> and
              <M>p</M> an odd prime.
</Item>
<Mark>(4)</Mark>
<Item>
 the remaining groups of order <M>5^5</M>, <M>7^4</M> and of order 
              <M>q^n \cdot p</M> for <M>q^n</M> dividing <M>3^6</M>, <M>5^5</M> or <M>7^4</M> and 
              <M>p \neq q</M> a prime.
</Item>
<Mark>(5)</Mark>

</Item>
<Mark>(10)</Mark>

               of squarefree order.
</Item>
<Mark>(11)</Mark>
<Item>
 the remaining groups of order <M>p^7</M> for <M>p = 3,5,7,11</M>.
</Item>

<P/>
The data in this library has been carefully checked and cross-checked.
It is believed to be reliable. However, no absolute guarantees are given
and users should, as always, make their own checks in critical cases.
<P/>
The data occupies about 30 MB (storing over 400 million groups in about
200 megabits). The group identification occupies about 47 MB of which
18 MB is used for the groups in layer (6). More information on the Small 
Groups library can be found on

<P/>
This library has been constructed by Hans Ulrich Besche, Bettina Eick and 
E.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;O'Brien. A survey on this topic and an account of the history of 
group constructions can be found in <Cite Key="BEO01"/>. Further detailed 
information on the construction of this library is available in <Cite Key="New77"/>, 
<Cite Key="OBr90"/>, <Cite Key="OBr91"/>, <Cite Key="BescheEick98"/>, <Cite Key="BescheEick1000"/>, 
<Cite Key="BescheEick768"/>, <Cite Key="BEO00"/>, <Cite Key="EOB99"/>, <Cite Key="EOB98"/>, <Cite Key="NOV04"/>, 
<Cite Key="Gir03"/>, <Cite Key="DEi05"/>, <Cite Key="OV05"/>.

The Small Groups library incorporates the &GAP;&nbsp;3 libraries <C>TwoGroup</C> and
<C>ThreeGroup</C>. The data from these libraries was directly included into the
Small Groups library, and the ordering there was preserved. The Small
Groups library replaces the Gap 3 library of solvable groups of order at
most 100. However, both the organisation and data descriptions of these
groups has changed in the Small Groups library.
