This file describes changes in the smallgrp package.

# 1.5 (2022-04-06)

  - Replaced the GAP Team as maintainer by Max Horn upon request by the
    authors
  - Corrected the number of groups of order 2^10 = 1024; it is 49487367289.
    This error was pointed out by David Burrell. For details refer
    to his paper "On the number of groups of order 1024", Comm. Alg. (2021), 1â€“3.

# 1.4.2 (2020-12-18)
  - In release 1.4, the ordering of groups of orders 3^7, 5^7, 7^7, 11^7 was
    aligned with Magma. However, due to an oversight this was not applied to
    SelectSmallGroups and hence not to OneSmallGroup, AllSmallGroups, and
    IdsOfAllSmallGroups. As a result, these commands in some rare cases may have
    produced a group with an incorrect IdGroup attribute set respectively
    listed some groups in the wrong order. This has been fixed.
